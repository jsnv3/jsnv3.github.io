I am a post-baccalaureate researcher as a part of Dr. Gautham Narayan's group at the University of Illinos Urbana-Champaign, where I got my bachelor's in Astrophysics and a Minor in Statistics. My research has primarily been focused on modeling supernovae properties in order to constrain the pathway by which massive stars explode. I've worked with archival Hubble Space Telescope data, as well as data from the Las Cumbrse Observatories, PAN-STARRS, ZTF, and Swope. I am also a member of the [Young Supernova Experiment](https://yse.ucsc.edu/), where I am currently leading the analysis of the Type II supernovae from our [first data release](https://jsnv3.github.io/publication/2023-05-The-Young-Supernova-Experiment-Data-Release-1-Light-Curves-and-Photometric-Classification-of1975-Supernovae). 
My previous work was with Dr. Charlie Kilpatrick as a part of Wen-fai Fong's group via the Northwestern CIERA REU. Here I worked on the supernova 2019mhm and constraining progenior properties for it (you can read about it [here](https://jsnv3.github.io/publication/2023-06-01-The-Type-IIP-Supernova-2019mhm-and-Constraints-on-its-Progenitor-System)).
